<p><strong>Assets</strong> fields allow you to upload/choose assets from the Assets area of the control panel. When you click on an Assets field, a popup window will appear displaying all the existing assets in that assets group (see image below). From this popup window you can either choose one (or more, depending on the entry type) of the existing assets, or upload a new one by clicking the grey <strong>Upload files</strong> button in the bottom left corner of the popup window.</p>

<p>Once you’ve chosen the relevant asset, click the red <strong>Select</strong> button at the bottom right of the popup window (see screenshot below).</p>

{% set assetsDashboard = craft.assets().filename('assets-dashboard.png').one() | default() %}
{% if assetsDashboard is not empty %}
	<img src="{{ assetsDashboard.url }}" alt="Assets Dashboard" />
{% endif %}

<p>A thumbnail image of the selected asset will now appear in place of the button in the Assets field. To choose a different asset, click the grey ‘cross’ icon next to the thumbnail and repeat the process.</p>

{% set assetsField = craft.assets().filename('assets-field.png').one() | default() %}
{% if assetsField is not empty %}
	<img src="{{ assetsField.url }}" alt="Assets Field" />
{% endif %}

<p>When you upload an image, the website will automatically create a variety of images of different sizes from this original image. The correct size image is then displayed on the website depending on the screen size of the device. This keeps the website loading times down and ensures that the end user isn’t downloading more data than they actually need.</p>
